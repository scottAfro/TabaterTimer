TabaterTimer
============

App for Window 8.1 phone Project
Scott Kennedy G00282748

In this app:
The main part of the app, the default work out time works, incrementing the time (rest time(10 seconds), work time(20 seconds),, and rest time(10 seconds), but as the app stands it doesn't display the actual timer. 
It all runs in the background.
The user is able to create their own timer times;
And then its able to connect to Onedrive.
